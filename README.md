# üß™ polymercost

**Python tools for polymer compounding:** Calculate **Cost**, **Specific Gravity (SPG)**, and estimate key **material properties** like Durometer, Modulus, and Tensile strength for compounded formulas.

---

## üíæ Installation

You can install `polymercost` using pip:

```bash
pip install polymercost
```

## üöÄ Usage
Here's a quick example of how to use the core functions:

Python
```
from polymercost import spg_costs, flex_clear_dop
```

 Define the compound formula: a list of tuples (Parts per Hundred Resin (phr), Specific Gravity (spg), Cost per pound ($))

Python
```
formula = [(100, 1.4, 0.475), (20, 2.71, 0.0625)]
```

 Calculate SPG, Cost by Weight, and Cost by Volume
```
spg, cost_wt, cost_vol = spg_costs(formula)
print(f"Calculated Specific Gravity (SG): {spg:.3f}")
print(f"Cost per Weight ($/lb): {cost_wt:.4f}")
print(f"Cost per Volume ($/in¬≥): {cost_vol:.4f}")
```

Example: Estimate properties for a clear flexible PVC compound with 50 phr DOP plasticizer

```
duro, mod, tens, elong, clash, brittle = flex_clear_dop(50)
print(f"\nEstimated Properties (50 phr DOP):")
print(f"  Durometer (Shore A): {duro}")
print(f"  100% Modulus (psi): {mod}")
print(f"  Tensile Strength (psi): {tens}")
```

## ‚ú® Features
spg_costs: The core function for calculating Specific Gravity, Cost/Weight, and Cost/Volume based on a compounded formula.

Property Estimators: Functions (like flex_clear_dop) to estimate properties for common polymer systems (e.g., Durometer, Tensile Strength, Elongation).  These are for example only as some are made on very sparse datasets.  Ideally you would derive your own formulas here from your own lab data.  These are included and based off limited data.
